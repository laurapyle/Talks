## Outline

- how I got into statistics, my career path
- some interesting projects I've worked on
- lessons learned???
- Q&A

## Undergraduate and graduate studies in biology

- BA Biology and MS in Evolutionary and Population Biology, George Mason University
- Worked with scientists at the Nature Conservancy to study patterns of plant communities and invasive species in the forests along the Potomac River

## Graduate studies in environmental science

- PhD program in Environmental Science at Duke University
- My research used diatoms to reconstruct the ecological history of Florida Bay

## My path to biostatistics

- While at Duke, I took graduate courses in statistics at North Carolina State University
- I was feeling less certain that I wanted to specialize in one particular research question, and statistics appealed to me as a tool to answer diverse questions
- I left my graduate program early with an MA and took a couple of years off
- Moved to the DC area and took a job as a Research Associate at the George Washington University Biostatistics Center

## Working at a "coordinating center"

- Coordinating centers are established for multi-center clinical trials
- They are responsible for advising on study design and the analytic plan, all aspects of data management, performing the statistical analysis, manuscript writing, and general oversight and communications
- Statisticians work as part of large teams along with programmers, content matter experts, administrators, etc.
- These are generally large projects with 1-2 years of planning prior to study start and 3-4 years of data collection
- Analysis usually begins when sufficient baseline data are collected

## The TODAY study

- The TODAY study was a clinical trial to compare 3 treatments for type 2 diabetes in children and adolescents
- Type 2 diabetes (T2D) used to be known as adult-onset diabetes and results from a combination of genetic and lifestyle factors (overweight, inactivity)
- The incidence of T2D among youth is increasing.<footnote>https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/research/reports/children-diabetes-rates-rise.html</footnote>
